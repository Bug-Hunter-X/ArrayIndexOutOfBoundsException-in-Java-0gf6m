This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common coding error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The error arises from an off-by-one error in a for loop.  The Bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while BugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The README file provides a description of the problem and the solution. This is a great example to illustrate the importance of careful loop indexing in Java.
